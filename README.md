Empirical Study For Code Search: IR-based methods

This project reproduced Lucene-base Information Retrieval methods for code search, which focus more on Query Expansion and modifying similarity calculation approach to improve conventional code search performance.

Methods include:

* [Base Lucene](https://github.com/BASE-LAB-SJTU/CSES_IR/wiki/Base-Lucene)
* [LuSearch](https://github.com/BASE-LAB-SJTU/CSES_IR/wiki/LuSearch)
* [QECK](https://github.com/BASE-LAB-SJTU/CSES_IR/wiki/QECK)
* [CodeHow](https://github.com/BASE-LAB-SJTU/CSES_IR/wiki/CodeHow)
